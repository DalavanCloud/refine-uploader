h1. Google Refine Uploader Extension

This allows you to export datasets from "Google Refine":http://code.google.com/p/google-refine/ and post them as JSON to web servers! Intended for use with CouchDB

**Work in progress!!** more docs soon

h2. Visual example:

Adds this dialog to Google Refine's interface:

h2. Installation

Run Google Refine. On the starting page click the "Browse workspace directory" link in the lower left corner. Make a folder called "extensions" within the the window that pops up.  Copy the refine-uploader folder into the extensions folder.  The final path should be:

<pre>
/PATH/TO/google/refine/extensions/refine-uploader/...
</pre>

Restart Google Refine.

h2. Hacking on the codez

* Check out the Google refine source code
* Go into the Refine base directory and run @ant@
* Run @./refine@
* Clone this repo into as the @extensions/uploader@ directory inside Google refine
* In another Terminal window go into the @extensions/uploader@ directory and run @ant@

Every time you change a file in @extensions/uploader@ and run @ant@ from that folder it will build the new extension and reload it in the running instance of Refine

h3. Thanks, Chicago Tribune!

This extension was based on the "Chicago Tribune's Stats Extension":https://github.com/newsapps/refine-stats for Google Refine.
